    "- **<span style=\"color:#FF69B4;\">Total logarithmic activity coefficient, ln(Œ≥):</span>**  is the sum of the residual and combinatorial terms. The Œ≥ provides a measure of the deviation from ideal behavior in a mixture\n",

    "- **<span style=\"color:#9370DB;\">Residual logarithmic activity coefficient (Enthalpic Results):</span>** takes into account the specific interactions between the segments and shows the difference in energy levels compared to a reference state.\n",
    "    - (+) results means that the molecules do not interact as well as they do in the reference state. This makes them more active than you would expect for an ideal solution.\n",
    "    - (-) results indicates more favorable interactions than in the reference state, resulting in a lower activity. This could be due to strong specific interactions like hydrogen bonding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<span style=\"color:#20B2AA;\">Combinatorial logarithmic activity coefficient:</span>** comes from the way different molecules in a mixture are shaped and their size. This is based on how much space they take up and their surface area. This term is a way of measuring the randomness of mixing molecules of different sizes.\n",
    "    - (+) results mean that there are significant size differences, leading to non-ideal mixing due to packing effects. Common for larger molecules.\n",
    "    - (-) results are less common but can occur in specific systems where the mixing of different-sized molecules leads to more efficient packing and increased entropy\n",
